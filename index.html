<h4>The story</h4>
<p class="myP">
<b>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
    That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,</b>
    <i> <span class="quote"> “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate. ”</span></i> The farmer said,
    <i> <span class="quote"> “Maybe.”</span></i> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody
    came back and said, <i><span class="quote"> “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</span></i> The farmer again said, <i><span class="quote"> “Maybe.”</span></i>

    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
    The neighbors then said, <i><span class="quote"> “Oh dear, that’s too<span class="Bad">Bad</span> ,”</span></i> and the farmer responded, <span class="quote"> “Maybe.”</span>
    The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son
    because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <i><span class="quote"> “Isn’t that great!”</span></i> Again, he said, <i><span class="quote"> “Maybe.</span></i>

    The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell
    whether anything that happens in it is<span class="Good"> good</span> or <span class="Bad">Bad</span>  — because
    you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences
    of <span class="Good">good</span> fortune.

    <h4>Conclusion </h4>


<blockquote class="conclusion"><i><span class="Good">Good</span> and  <span class="Bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="Good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not<span class="Good">good</span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
